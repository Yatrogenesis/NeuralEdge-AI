###  Enhanced Collaboration Capabilities

#### Project Management System
```typescript
// Comprehensive Project Collaboration
const project = await collaborationManager.createSharedProject(
  "AI Research Project",
  "Collaborative AI development workspace",
  {
    allowComments: true,
    allowEditing: true,
    autoSync: true,
    notifyOnChanges: true,
    maxCollaborators: 25
  }
);

// Invite users with role-based permissions
await collaborationManager.inviteUserToProject(
  project.data.id,
  "collaborator@example.com",
  "editor"
);
```

#### Real-Time Memory Sharing
```typescript
// Share memories with instant collaboration
const shareResult = await collaborationManager.shareMemory(
  vectorMemory,
  project.id,
  [{
    resource: 'memory',
    action: 'write',
    granted: true,
    grantedBy: currentUser.id,
    grantedAt: new Date()
  }]
);

// Real-time updates to all collaborators
await realTimeManager.sendMessage({
  type: 'memory_update',
  projectId: project.id,
  data: { memoryId: memory.id, action: 'shared' },
  priority: 'medium'
});
```

#### Collaborative MCP Execution
```typescript
// Execute MCP tools collaboratively
const toolResult = await mcpManager.executeToolCollaboratively(
  { tool: 'analyze_data', arguments: { dataset: 'research.csv' } },
  project.id,
  true // Share results with collaborators
);

// Share resources across projects
const shareLink = await mcpManager.shareResourceWithProject(
  'file://research/dataset.csv',
  project.id,
  ['read', 'analyze']
);
```

###  Collaboration Integration Metrics

#### User Engagement
- **Concurrent Collaborators**: Up to 25 per project
- **Real-time Updates**: Sub-50ms notification delivery
